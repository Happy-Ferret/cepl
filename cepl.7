.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
CEPL is a command-line, interactive C11 Read-Eval-Print Loop, useful for instantaneous prototyping, mathematical calculations, and
general algorithm exploration.

.SH "USAGE"
.sp
CEPL currently supports readline key-bindings/tab-completion and the ability to specify additional shared libraries or headers with the “-l” or “-I” switches respectively.
.sp
A list of completions can also be generated on-demand for each “-l” library using “nm” and “perl” by passing the “-p” switch.

.SS "COMMANDS"
Input lines prefixed with a “;” are used to control internal state.
